# Neuroanalytics Dataset "Help Desk"

This is a small `jupyter-book` developed to introduce and document the
available open resources and datasets that might be useful as part of
participation in the Canadian Neuroanalytics Scholars Program.

This is a growing resource and can be shared and added to by
anyone. The goal is to provide a useful starting point to research
projects that can capitalize on existing open data resources.

The structure of this documentation is still in its early stages - if
there is systematic structure or information you want to see, please
make a PR.

Check out the initial content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
