# Canadian Neuroanalytics Scholars Data Documentation

This book is meant to serve as a collective notation of the data,
projects, and scholars awarded the Canadian Neuroanalytics Scholars
Fellowship. Scholars will contribute brief descriptions and notes
describing:

 - Projects undertaken as part of their fellowship.
 - The methods, statistical techniques, and software they use in their
   projects.
 - The datasets they use to explore their questions and how new users can get
   started with those same datasets.
 - The portals for accessing those (and many other) datasets.
 - An introduction to the scholars and their work.

The goal is to create reference materials maintained by a cohort of
scientists working on similar projects. This can serve as a landing
page and reference for anyone interested in the work conducted by the
CNS Scholars.
